We will use the IMDB dataset---it contains the text of some reviews and the sentiment given by their authors (either positive or negative). The input to the RNN is the sequence of words that compose a review, so the learning task consists in predicting the overall sentiment of the review.\n","In the first part, we will learn how to develop a simple RNN, then we will explore the differences in terms of computational load, number of parameters, and performances with respect to more advanced recurrent models, like LSTM and GRU. Subsequently, we experiment with the bi-directional model to unveil the strengths and the weaknesses of this technique. Finally, we will solve the same classification problem with a Transformer, in order to have a closer look at its internal functioning.\n","\n","---\n","##**Important Instructions for Submissions:**\n","\n","Generally, in the homeworks, you will be either required to complete a part of Python code or to answer questions in text cells. Code and text cells where you are expected to write your answers have been marked by `%STARTCODE` and `%ENDCODE` or `%STARTEXT` and `%ENDTEXT` tags, respectively.

So the next layer will receive 3D batches of shape (batch size, 500, 10)\n","- The second layer is the recurrent one. In particular, in this case, we use a [RNN](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.RNN.html), LSTM and GRU.\n","- The output layer is linear one that maps the model output to the target space and applies a sigmoid function (we are using a [Binary Cross-Entropy Loss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.BCELoss.html#torch.nn.BCELoss) which, differently from Cross-Entropy Loss, expects probabilities as input)\n","\n","### Model Comparison\n","\n","In order to perform a fair comparison of the models RNN, LSTM and GRU make sure they use more or less the same number of parameters.\n","\n","In the next cell, we define our simple RNN used for binary classification. The class has two main methods, the constructor (`init()`) and the `forward()` method.\n","\n","In the constructor, the input parameters are used to define the layers and hyperparameters of the RNN. The layers that are defined include an embedding layer (`self.embedding`), a recurrent layer (`self.rnn`), and a linear layer (`self.linear`). The constructor also sets up various parameters such as the embedding input size, the embedding output size, the hidden size, the number of layers, the batch size, the RNN type, and whether or not the RNN is bidirectional.\n","\n","The `forward()` method takes a batch of input data (`x`) and applies the layers defined in the constructor in a specific sequence. First, the input is passed through the embedding layer to create embeddings of the input tokens. These embeddings are then permuted to be of the correct shape for the RNN layer, which expects inputs of the form (`seq_len, batch_size, H_in`). The RNN layer is then applied to these embeddings, producing both the RNN output (`rnn_out`) and the last hidden state (`self.last_hidden`). Finally, the output of the RNN is passed through a linear layer and flattened to produce the final output of the network, which is a sigmoid activation function applied to a tensor of shape (`batch_size`). This output is then returned.\n","\n","**[TO COMPLETE]** Implement the forward method."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"oPb_W9K5Zyk-"},"source":["`%STARTCODE%`"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"nTY5n-t7X3VD"},"outputs":[],"source":["class My_RNN(nn.Module):\n","  def __init__(self, vocab_length, emb_dim, hidden_size, num_layers, rnn_dropout,\n","               batch_size, RNN_type, bidirectional, device=device):\n","    super().__init__()\n","    self.emb_in_dim = vocab_length  # 10000\n","    self.emb_out_dim = emb_dim  # 10\n","    self.hidden_size = hidden_size\n","    self.num_layers = num_layers\n","    self.bidirectional = bidirectional\n","    self.batch_size = batch_size\n","    self.RNN_type = RNN_type\n","    self.target_size = 1  # binary classification\n","    self.device = device\n","    self.D = 2 if self.bidirectional else 1  # enable/disable bidirectional\n","\n","    valid_types = {'Simple RNN':RNN, 'LSTM':LSTM, 'GRU':GRU}\n","    assert self.RNN_type in valid_types.keys(), f'You must choose one of {valid_types.keys()} types'\n","\n","    self.embedding = Embedding(self.emb_in_dim, self.emb_out_dim)\n","\n","    chosen_rnn = valid_types[self.RNN_type]\n","    self.rnn = chosen_rnn(input_size=self.emb_out_dim, hidden_size=self.hidden_size,\n","                          num_layers=self.num_layers, dropout=rnn_dropout, bidirectional = self.bidirectional)\n","\n","    self.linear = Linear(self.D*self.hidden_size, self.target_size)\n","\n","  def forward(self, x):\n","    # x: (batch_size, 500)\n","    # [TO COMPLETE]\n","\n","    # Embeds have shape (batch_size, 500, 10)\n","    # But rnn receives inputs of: (500, batch_size, 10) (seq_len, batch_size, H_in)\n","    # [TO COMPLETE]\n","\n","    rnn_out, self.last_hidden =  # [TO COMPLETE]\n","    # rnn_out: (500, 256, 2*5:10) -> (seq_len, batch_size, D*hidden_size)\n","    # h_n: (1, 256, hidden_size) -> (D*num_layers, batch_size, hidden_size)\n","\n","    # hint: pay attention to WHICH output dimension corresponds to the elements of the sequence\n","    # [TO COMPLETE]\n","\n","    #output: (256, 1) -> (batch_size, target_size)\n","    output = output.flatten()\n","    #output: (256) -> (batch_size)\n","    return F.sigmoid(output)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"L_Iv4QVcZyk_"},"source":["`%ENDCODE%`"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QmakxXHJjlJR"},"source":["\n","The code below allows us to do a verifcation of the model in term of any implementation error.
